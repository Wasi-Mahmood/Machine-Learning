You need to stop completely changing your system and software already. It's annoying.I would also like to see Microsoft get with hardware manufactures and convince them to install a memory chip on all hardware with a driver / software bin,rar or zip file on the actual hardware device. Thus, when installing any Windows operating system. Windows would recognize all devices as flash drives, at first. Then access them for the drivers/software.Simple forward and backward, system restores or installs. Secondly, have all motherboards require a direct solid state drive for just Windows operating systems to be flashed too. Basically like an XBOX. Windows would be protected from viruses by a simple program that monitors the file structure of the main ss hdd drive. If files are modified. The next reboot, sets the files back to factory. All personal files would be on the customers hdd. 😉 Easy!...not to mention, upgrading or replacing a hdd, would be a piece of cake.

All hidden drives of course. Except via command prompt or even a certified installer accessible, for driver / software updates.Lastly Windows, by default.

But people can\\'t really hear it with normal headphones. Most headphones can\\'t handle the bass, the detail, the dynamics. Bottom line, the music doesn\\'t move you.With Beats, people are going to hear what the artists hear, and listen to the music the way they should: the way I do.It\\'s All About Sound.Beats™ are precision engineered to reveal the full sound of your music, including the most sonically demanding Rock, Hip Hop and R&B. Big, powerful speakers dwarf the sound of standard earbuds and drop the bass low like you\\'re in the club. Proprietary driver technologies wired with Monster™ cable make every track a new music experience with bold, punchy bass and insane clarity.Ultimate listening isn\\'t just what you hear, but what you don\\'t. Monster powered isolation technology cut unwanted external noise, so all you hear is the music.What are OEM products???OEM (original equipment manufacturer) refers to companies that originally make the products for others to repackage and sell(say for example an outsourcing company in China). Resellers(like Beats™ & Monster™) buy OEM products in bulk, minus the costly retail packaging that comes with individually sold units. The product itself is essentially THE SAME as its more expensive, retail-packaged sibling.In short, OEMs are basically the same with their original counterparts - same sound quality, same process but not the same price. The relatively BIIIIGGGG difference with the price comes with those costly product advertising, fancy packaging, add-on materials(cds&manuals), shop rent, etc.So what would you choose? The original that costs tens of thousands of pesos or OEMs with the same sound quality but for 1/10 of the original price? Your choice.
