# Machine-Learning




	The project is based on the Contradiction on the sentimental 
	values of emojis and sentences.
	example: if the sentence sentimental value is positive and 
	the emojis on that sentence is negative then there might be 
	sarcasm in that sentence.



1- Make the python virtual Enviroment before running the project.
   the project includes many different libraries. To include them in 
   project Virtual Enviroment is crutial.

   all the Details for virtual enviroment is present in 
   "Python Virtual Enviroment.txt" file

2- emojies and lables datasets are used to obtain the sentimental 
   values for emojis and word respectively.

3- TEST1 Dataset is used to then train the model
4- This project lacks the Testing and accuracy function
   since the dataset used is polarized.

5- The make the Testing and accuracy function, shuffel the dataset.
